== Introduction

=== LiBerry
LiBerry is a desktop app for librarians to *quickly manage their community libraries!*
LiBerry is optimized for librarians who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the
benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
You can type quickly and serve your long line of borrowers in a short amount of time.
LiBerry can manage all your books and borrowers efficiently and meticulously.

=== Purpose of Developer Guide
This developer guide is targeted towards *potential developers* of the project and it aims to explain:

* The *design* of the software architecture of the system using a top-down approach
* The *implementation* and *behaviour* of the main features of the system.

=== Legend
// How to use developer guide

== Setting up

To set up LiBerry on your system, please refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design
In this section, we will explain the design and behaviour of the top-level components in the system, which are the following:

* Architecture overview
* User Interface (UI) Component
* Logic Component
* Model Component
* Storage Component

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
This sub-section shows the *relationship* between the major components at the highest level, illustrated by the following diagram.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

{nbsp} +

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the system consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the system.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the system in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `add t/Animal Farm a/George`.

.Component interactions for `add t/Animal Farm a/George` command
image::AddBook.png[]
{nbsp} +

In the diagram above, we can see how the components integrate together to execute a single command. +
{nbsp} +
The sections below give more details about each component, starting of with the UI component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
This sub-section shows the structure of the User Interface (UI) and the relationship between each component in the UI. +
{nbsp} +
The following diagram aims to illustrate how each UI sub-component is linked to one another.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]
{nbsp} +

In the figure above, we can see the association between the different UI sub-components, as well as the classes that interact with the external `Logic` and `Model` components.

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up these main parts:

* `CommandBox`
* `ResultDisplay`
* `BookListPanel`
*  Other smaller components

All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within
the UI component when the user enters an add command.
The exact command entered is `add t/Animal Farm a/George`.

.Interactions Inside the UI Component for the `add t/Animal Farm a/George` Command
image::UiAddBookSequenceDiagram.png[]
{nbsp} +

In the figure above, we can see how the UI components invoke the `execute` method of the `Logic` class in order to obtain and subsequently display the result of the execution.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens to the `UI` component
when a user executes a new command:

.Flow of Events within `UI`
image::UiUpdateBookListActivityDiagram.png[width=270]
{nbsp} +
The activity diagram above aims to illustrate how `UI` only updates the `BookListPanel` when the catalog is being updated by a command. +
We will now move on to give more details about the `Logic` component.
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
In this sub-section, we will explain the internal workings of the `Logic` component, which handles the execution of the different commands. +
{nbsp} +
The following class diagram aims to show how the 'Command Design Pattern' is used to achieve a high-level form of encapsulation of the `Command` object.
[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]
{nbsp} +
In the diagram above, we can see that the `LogicManager` executes the `Command` class without knowledge of what each command does. This is achieve through polymorphism where all possible commands extend from the `Command` class.

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `CatalogParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a book).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add t/Animal Farm a/George")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add t/Animal Farm a/George` Command
image::AddBookLogicSequenceDiagram.png[]
{nbsp} +
In the diagram above, we can see that the `Logic` component's `execute` is invoked by the `UI` component from before. A series of method calls would invoke the `addBook` method of the `Model`, moving the chain of calls further downstream.

NOTE: The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
{nbsp} +

In short, the `Logic` component interprets the different commands and execute them accordingly. Most of these commands will have to interact with the `Model` component, which will will explore in the next sub-section.
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component
The `Model` component is mainly composed of the `Book`, `Borrower` and `Loan` classes and shows how they are related to one another.
{nbsp} +

The figure below shows the relationship between smaller components. These smaller components are modelled after real world objects.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]
{nbsp} +

The figure illustrates the composition of the `Model` component. The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Catalog data.
* stores the Loan Records.
* stores the Borrower Records.
* references a borrower that is being served if the model is in serve mode.
* references a list of filtered books which depends on the state of the model.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Book>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

{nbsp} +
When there are changes in the `Model` component, the system will update its in-memory via the `Storage` component, which will be explained in-depth in the next section.
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
The `Storage` component is responsible for updating the memory of the system (in `JSON` format) whenever there are changes.

{nbsp} +
The figure below aims to show the different records storage that is implemented in LiBerry.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]
{nbsp} +

In the figure above, we can see that we are maintaining 4 different storages. These storages aim to keep the memory of:

* `UserPrefs`
* `Catalog`
* `BorrowerRecords`
* `LoanRecords`

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in `JSON` format and read it back.
* can save LiBerry data in `JSON` format and read it back.

There are certain classes (eg. Utility classes) that are used by different components. In the following section, we will explain how we allow all components to access these classes.
[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.
These classes include (to list a few):

* User Settings
* Exceptions
* Utility classes like `DateUtil` and `JsonUtil`

We will now move on to the next section, which aims to explain the implementation of some of our main features.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::addBook[]
=== Add book feature
This feature allows a user to add a new book to the LiBerry system.

==== Implementation

The add book function is facilitated by `Catalog`.
The `Catalog` stores a list of books, representing the books in the library.
Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `Catalog#addBook(book)` -- Add a new book to the list of books in the catalog.

Given below is an activity diagram of a book being added to the catalog.

.Activity Diagram for adding a book
image::AddBookActivityDiagram.png[width=270]
{nbsp} +

Given below is a class diagram of a book after being added to the catalog.

.Class Diagram for `Book`
image::BookClassDiagram.png[width=400]
{nbsp} +

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to store books.

* **Alternative 1 :** Store them only in a ObservableList as per the original AddressBook implementation.
** Pros: Will be easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of efficiency in retrieving books.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Store them in a HashMap.
** Pros: Will be easier (and more readable in code) to retrieve books by serial number.
** Cons: Will incur additional memory to maintain the HashMap.

===== Aspect: Generating a unique serial number.
Since we allow librarians to provide a valid serial number to new books if they wish so, we cannot generate the serial
number using the number of books or the largest serial number.

Eg: The system now has "B00009" and "B00010".

If we generate based on number of books, we get the serial number "B00003", wasting the serial numbers "B00001" and "B00002".

If we generate based on the largest serial number, we get the serial number "B00011", wasting all the unused serial numbers before it.

We need to come up with a solution to give us "B00001" in the given example.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a TreeMap to store current serial numbers such that we can efficiently determine the next serial number in running order.
** Pros: Will be efficient in generating the next valid serial number.
** Cons: Will incur additional memory to maintain the TreeMap.
* **Alternative 2:** Use brute force to start iterating from "B00001" to obtain the first unused serial number.
** Pros: Will be easy to implement.
** Cons: Will be inefficient once the number of books grow.
//end::addBook[]

// tag::undo/redo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedCatalog`.
It extends `Catalog` with an undo/redo command history, stored internally as an `commandHistoryList` and `currentCommandPointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedCatalog#commit()` -- Saves the current reversible command in its command history.
* `VersionedCatalog#undo()` -- Restores the previous catalog state using its command history.
* `VersionedCatalog#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone catalog state using its command history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitCatalog()`, `Model#undoCatalog()` and `Model#redoCatalog()` respectively.

The undo/redo mechanism only works for commands that implements the `ReversibleCommand` interface.
The `ReversibleCommand` interface specifies that the commands these two operations:

* `ReversibleCommand#getUndoCommand()` -- Returns a command that undo the `ReversibleCommand`.
* `ReversibleCommand#getRedoCommand()` -- Returns a command that redo the `ReversibleCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedCatalog` will be initialized with an empty `commandHistoryList`.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[width=300]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th book in the catalog. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitCatalog()`, causing the `delete 5` command to be saved in the `catalogHistoryList`, and the `currentCommandPointer` is pointed to the newly inserted command.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[width=300]

Step 3. The user executes `add t/Animal Farm ...` to add a new book.
The `add` command also calls `Model#commitCatalog()`, causing the add
command to be saved into the `catalogHistoryList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[width=300]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitCatalog()`, so the command will not be saved into the `commandHistoryList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the book was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCatalog()`, which will call `ReversibleCommand#getUndoCommand()` to get the command to undo
the add command. This undo command would then be executed, which will shift the `currentCommandPointer` once to the left,
pointing it to the previous command,

image::UndoRedoState3.png[width=300]

[NOTE]
If the `currentCommandPointer` is at index -1, pointing to no command, then there are no previous command to undo. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoCatalog()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoCatalog()`, which shifts the `currentCommandPointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone Command, and executes that Command.

[NOTE]
If the `currentCommandPointer` is at index `catalogHistoryList.size() - 1`,
pointing to the latest command, then there are no undone command to execute.
The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCatalog()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `find t/Animal Farm`.
Commands that do not modify the catalog, such as `find t/Animal Farm`,
will usually not call `Model#commitCatalog()`,`Model#undoCatalog()` or
`Model#redoCatalog()`. Thus, the `catalogHistoryList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[width=300]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitCatalog()`.
Since the `currentCommandPointer` is not pointing at the end of the `commandHistoryList`,
all commands after the `currentCommandPointer` will be purged.
We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the
`add t/Animal Farm ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[width=300]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the book being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
* **Alternative 2:** Saves the entire catalog.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use two stacks to store a list of undoable and redoable commands.
** Pros: Easy for future developers to understand as there are two separate stacks to keep track of the command to undo and redo.
** Cons: Additional time required to add and pop from the stack.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a list to store the commands for undo and redo.
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack.
** Cons: Harder for new developers to understand.
// end::undo/redo[]

// tag::printLoanSlip[]
=== Generate Loan Slip feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The printing of loan slip feature is facilitated by `LoanSlipUtil`.
Essentially, it implements the following operations:

* `LoanSlipUtil#mountLoan()` -- Mounts a loan slip in preparation for generation of loan slip in pdf form.
* `LoanSlipUtil#unmountLoan()` -- Unmounts a loan slip ,usually after generating a pdf version of it.
* `LoanSlipUtil#createLoanSlipInDirectory()` -- Creates a pdf version of the mounted loan slip in the loan_slips folder.

Given below is the sequence diagram of the generation of loan slip during the loan of a book.

.Sequence Diagram for the generation of a loan slip
image::LoanSlipGeneration.png[]
{nbsp} +

The following describes the sequence of events displayed in the figure above.
****
1) The `LoanCommand` is executed +
2) The `LoanCommand` retrieves the `Book` and the `Borrower` +
3) The `LoanCommand` creates a new `Loan` +
4) The `LoanCommand` mounts the new loan in `LoanSlipUtil` +
5) The `Storage` component creates and save a new `LoanSlipDocument` in a saved folder +
6) The `Logic` component opens the newly generated `LoanSlipDocument` for the librarian to print it immediately +
7) The `Logic` component unmounts the `LoanSlipDocument` at the end of the process
****

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to create and use an instance of a `LoanSlipDocument`.

* **Alternative 1 :** Use the `LoanSlipDocument` constructor directly.
** Pros: Will be straightforward to implement.
** Cons: The `Logic` component and the `LoanCommand` object needs to have knowledge on all individual methods of `LoanSlipDocument` to be able to create a loan slip.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Create a Facade class `LoanSlipUtil` to facilitate creation of `LoanSlipDocument`.
** Pros: The `Logic` component and the `LoanCommand` object can now use the full functionality of `LoanSlipDocument` via the static class `LoanSlipUtil` without knowing the internal implementation of `LoanSlipDocument`.
** Cons: There is more code to be written and we must consider how to save state within a static class such that it can be continually reused.

We have decided to go with Alternative 2. The Facade class provides the system with a *simplified view* of generating a loan slip, making it *easier to use*. It also *decouples* the code, making it easier to modify in the future.

===== Aspect: Implementation to allow extension (loan multiple books at one go).

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Mount a loan in `LoanSlipUtil` for each book.
** Pros: Will be easy to extend in the future as we can just mount multiple loans using `LoanSlipUtil` before generating all loans in a single loan slip.
** Cons: Will require more code when mounting loans in the Facade class.
* **Alternative 2:** Re-create `LoanSlipDocument` whenever a new loan comes in.
** Pros: Will only need to make adjustments to `Logic` component to contain an `Optional<LoanSlipDocument>` field and update accordingly whenever a new `Loan` comes in.
** Cons: Violates Single Responsibility Principle as the Logic class will now have to change if we change the implementation of `LoanSlipDocument`.
// end::printLoanSlip[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Book loaning feature

==== Functionalities
The functionalities and commands associated with the book loaning feature are:

* `loan sn/BOOK_SN`

** Loans out a book based on its serial number.

* `return INDEX [-all]`

** Returns a book based on the index of that book shown on the GUI.

* `renew INDEX [-all]`

** Renews a book based on the index of that book shown on the GUI.

* `reserve sn/BOOK_SN` or `reserve INDEX`

** Reserves a book based on its serial number or index of that book shown on the GUI.

* `pay AMOUNT`

** Pay a fine amount for overdue books.

The rationale for the different types of arguments for the loan, return, renew and reserve may not be apparent at first,
but it is actually very simple.

* When borrowers come to the librarian (our user) to borrow a book, the book itself would have
a serial number. Thus, the user just types in the serial number of the book to be loaned out, instead of using the find
command to locate that book in LiBerry to use its index.

* Whereas, when a borrower comes to return a book, the librarian only sees a limited list of book that was loaned out by
the borrower on the GUI. Hence, the librarian need not type the longer serial number to return that book, and instead, types
its index shown in the GUI list. Likewise, the same idea is applied to renewing books

* When reserving books for borrowers, it is possible that the book is found through the GUI, and thus, index is used. Or,
the borrower brings the physical book forward to reserve it as he/she does not want to borrow it now.

==== Implementation

This feature is mainly facilitated by the `Loan` association class between a `Book` and a `Borrower`. The object diagram
just after a book is loaned out can be seen below.

.Loan object diagram after a new Loan is created
image::LoanObjectDiagram.png[width="880"]
{nbsp} +

In this instance, the `Borrower` with `BorrowerId` K0789 currently has a `Book` with `SerialNumber` B00456 loaned out.
The `Loan` associated to this loan, with `LoanId` L000123, is stored in the `LoanRecords` class of the model component.

Both the `Book` and `Borrower` objects also have access to this `Loan` object.

In each `Loan` object, only the `BorrowerId` of the `Borrower` and `SerialNumber` of the `Book` is stored to reduce
circular dependency.

The `LoanRecords` class stores all the `Loan` objects tracked by LiBerry in a HashMap, where the key is its `LoanId`.

Immutability of each object is supported to ensure correctness of undo and redo functionality.

===== Loaning

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters a loan command:

.Activity diagram when a loan command is entered
image::LoaningActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]
{nbsp} +

NOTE: The else branch of each branch node should have a guard condition `[else]` but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
they are not shown.

When a book is successfully loaned out by a borrower, a new `Loan` object is created. The `LoanId` is automatically generated according
to the number of loans in the `LoanRecords` object in the model. The `startDate` is also automatically set to today's date.
The `endDate` is automatically set according to the loan period set in the user settings. This `Loan` object is added to
`LoanRecords` through the call to `Model#addLoan(loan)`.

The new `Borrower` instance is created by copying the details of the borrower from the original object, and also with this `Loan`
object being added into its `currentLoanList`. The new borrower object then replaces the old borrower object in the
`BorrowerRecords` object in the model. These two steps are done through the method call to `Model#servingBorrowerNewLoan(loan)`.
The new `Book` instance is also created by copying the details of the original book object, and likewise, with this `Loan` object added into it.
Similarly, the new book object replaces the old book object in the `Catalog` object in the model through the call to
`Model#setBook(bookToBeLoaned, loanedOutBook)`. These were done to support immutability of the objects.

===== Returning

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters a return command:

.Activity diagram when a book is being returned.
image::ReturningActivityDiagram.png[width="820"]
{nbsp} +

NOTE: The else branch of each branch node should have a guard condition `[else]` but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
they are not shown.

When a loaned out book is successfully returned by a borrower, the associated `Loan` object is moved from the borrower's
`currentLoanList` to `returnedLoanList`. Inside the book object, this `Loan` object is also removed. Inside this loan
object, the `returnDate` is added according to today's date. The `remainingFineAmount` of this loan object is also
calculated based on the fine amount set in the user settings.

Similarly, the creation of new objects for replacement are also done to support immutability. They are supported by the
methods `Model#setBook(bookToBeReturned, returnedBook)` and `Model#servingBorrowerReturnLoan(returningLoan)`.

===== Renewing

When a book is successfully renewed by a borrower, the `renewCount` of the `Loan` object is incremented by 1
and its `dueDate` is also increased by the renew period set in the user settings.

Similarly, the creation of new objects for replacement are also done to support immutability.

===== Reserving

When a book is successfully reserved by a borrower, the `Book` object is marked as reserved and is added to the borrower's
`reservedBookList`.

Similarly, the creation of new objects for replacement are also done to support immutability.

===== Paying fines

When a fine amount is successfully paid by a borrower, the `remainingFineAmount` and `paidFineAmount` of the loans in
the borrower's `returnedLoanList` is updated accordingly.

Similarly, the creation of new objects for replacement are also done to support immutability.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: File storage of loans

Inside the model, for each current loan (loans that are not returned yet), the `Book`, the `Borrower` and the `LoanRecords`
point to the same the same `Loan` object. LiBerry's storage system is such that `Catalog` stores the books,
`BorrowerRecords` stores the borrowers and `LoanRecords` stores the loans. Thus, a decision was made to decide how these
loans are serialized and stored in the user's file system.

* **Alternative 1:** Save the whole `Loan` object in each book in the `catalog.json` and save the the whole of every `Loan`
object in each borrower in `borrowerrecords.json`. The `Loan` object is also duplicated in `loanrecords.json`.
** Pros: Easy to implement. No need to read storage files in a specific order.
** Cons: Storage memory size issues. Same information is duplicated and stored in all 3 storage files.

* **Alternative 2 (selected choice):** Save only the `LoanId` of each `Loan` object in each book in the `catalog.json`
and save a list of `LoanId` in each borrower in `borrowerrecords.json`. The whole `Loan` object is only saved in
`loanrecords.json`. When reading the storage files at the start of the application, `loanrecords.json` need to be read
in first, before the borrowers and books can be read in as they would get the loan objects from the `LoanRecords` based
on their `LoanId` s.
** Pros: Uses less memory as only `LoanId` is stored for the books and borrowers, instead of the whole serialized loan objects.
Also, `LoanRecords` thus serve as a single source of truth.
** Cons: Must ensure that the reading of stored files are in the correct order, and also correct `Loan` objects are referenced
after reading in `borrowerrecords.json` and `catalog.json`. Method used to retrieve a `Loan` object from its `LoanId` must
also be fast enough as there can be hundreds of thousands of loans.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support recording of loans in LoanRecords

* **Alternative 1:** Use a list data structure, such as an `ArrayList` to store the loans in the model component.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Easy to obtain insertion order of the loans and sort through the list.
** Cons: Slow to search for a `Loan` based on its `LoanId`, i.e., O(n) time, as the list must be traversed to find the
correct associated `Loan` object. The additional time taken adds up when reading the storage files during the starting
up of the application. Thus, it can make the application feel laggy and unresponsive at the start.

* **Alternative 2 (selected choice):** Use a `HashMap` to store the loans, where the key is its `LoanId`.
** Pros: Fast to retrieve a `Loan` object based on its `LoanId`, i.e., O(1) time.
** Cons: Insertion order is not preserved. Have to traverse through all the loan objects in the HashMap to check their
`startDate` in order to obtain their insertion order.

=== Book Finding
The command for finding a book in the catalog is as follows: +
`find { [t/TITLE] [a/AUTHOR] [g/GENRE]... [sn/BOOK_SN]] [-overdue] [-loaned] [-available] } [NUMBER]`

ModelManager contains a `FilteredList` of `Books` (`filteredBooks`), which is used to display books on the LiBerry GUI. Book finding works by
starting converting the command string in to a `BookPredicate` object, then updating `filteredBooks` with that predicate.

The parsing of the `BookPredicate` object is done with the help of the `ArgumentTokenizer` object to generate an
`ArgumentMultimap`, which is internally a HashMap of predicate values paired to prefix keys. The `FindCommandParser`
then extracts all the values from the `ArgumentMultimap` prefix by prefix and building the predicate through functions
such as `setTitle()`, `setGenres()` etc.

//tag::registerBorrower[]
=== Register borrower feature
==== Implementation
The `register` borrower feature is facilitated by `BorrowerRecords`. The BorrowerRecords stores a list of borrowers,
representing the borrowers registered into the library system. The command to register a borrower into the library
system is as followed: +

`register n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL`

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Generating a unique borrower ID
Every time a new borrower is being registered, the system will automatically generate a borrower ID for the borrower
which the borrower will have to use every time the borrower borrows books from the library.
Initially, what we proposed is that, every time a new borrower is being registered into the system, we find the size of
the list of borrowers, we add 1 and set it as the borrower ID of the new borrower.

Eg: There are 100 borrowers in the system. The new borrower's ID will be "K0101".

However, we decided to implement a new function, which is to allow borrowers to be removed from the library system.
Therefore, this method does not work anymore. So we decided to change to generate the new ID based on the first-found
available ID.

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* a librarian in a small town library that has to serve many library users (borrowers) quickly
* has a need to manage a significant number of books and borrowers
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: Many people visit the neighborhood library to borrow books and also donate their books. There is
always a long queue in this small library and the librarian would have to type quickly to handle the long queue. LiBerry
can manage a library system faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
