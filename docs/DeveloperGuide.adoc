== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `add t/Animal Farm a/George`.

.Component interactions for `add t/Animal Farm a/George` command

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `CatalogParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a book).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Catalog data.
* stores the Loan Records.
* stores the Borrower Records.
* references a borrower that is being served if the model is in serve mode.
* references a list of filtered books which depends on the state of the model.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Book>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::addBook[]
=== Add book feature
==== Implementation

The add book function is facilitated by `Catalog`.
The `Catalog` stores a list of books, representing the books in the library.
Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `Catalog#addBook(book)` -- Add a new book to the list of books in the catalog.

Given below is an activity diagram of a book being added to the catalog.

image::AddBookActivityDiagram.png[]

Given below is a class diagram of a book after being added to the catalog.

image::BookClassDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to store books.

* **Alternative 1 :** Store them only in a ObservableList as per the original AddressBook implementation.
** Pros: Will be easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of efficiency in retrieving books.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Store them in a HashMap.
** Pros: Will be easier (and more readable in code) to retrieve books by serial number.
** Cons: Will incur additional memory to maintain the HashMap.

===== Aspect: Generating a unique serial number.
Since we allow librarians to provide a valid serial number to new books if they wish so, we cannot generate the serial
number using the number of books or the largest serial number.

Eg: The system now has "B00009" and "B00010".

If we generate based on number of books, we get the serial number "B00003", wasting the serial numbers "B00001" and "B00002".

If we generate based on the largest serial number, we get the serial number "B00011", wasting all the unused serial numbers before it.

We need to come up with a solution to give us "B00001" in the given example.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a TreeMap to store current serial numbers such that we can efficiently determine the next serial number in running order.
** Pros: Will be efficient in generating the next valid serial number.
** Cons: Will incur additional memory to maintain the TreeMap.
* **Alternative 2:** Use brute force to start iterating from "B00001" to obtain the first unused serial number.
** Pros: Will be easy to implement.
** Cons: Will be inefficient once the number of books grow.
// end::addbook[]

// tag::printLoanSlip[]
=== [Proposed] Print loan slip feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The printing of loan slip feature is facilitated by `LoanSlipIUtil`.
Essentially, it implements the following operations:

* `LoanSlipUtil#mountLoanSlip()` -- Mounts a loan slip in preparation for generation of loan slip in pdf form.
* `LoanSlipUtil#unmountLoanSlip()` -- Unmounts a loan slip ,usually after generating a pdf version of it.
* `LoanSlipUtil#createLoanSlipInDirectory()` -- Creates a pdf version of the mounted loan slip in the loan_slips folder.

Given below is the sequence diagram of the generation of loan slip during the loan of a book.

image::LoanSlipGeneration.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to create and use an instance of a `LoanSlipDocument`.

* **Alternative 1 :** Use the `LoanSlipDocument` constructor directly.
** Pros: Will be straightforward to implement.
** Cons: The `Logic` component and the `LoanCommand` object needs to have knowledge on all individual methods of `LoanSlipDocument` to be able to create a loan slip.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Create a Facade class `LoanSlipUtil` to facilitate creation of `LoanSlipDocument`.
** Pros: The `Logic` component and the `LoanCommand` object can now use the full functionality of `LoanSlipDocument` via the static class `LoanSlipUtil` without knowing `LoanSlipDocument`'s internal implementation.
** Cons: There is more code to be written and we must consider how to save state within a static class such that it can be continually reused.

===== Aspect: Implementation to allow extension (loan multiple books at one go).

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Mount a loan in `LoanSlipUtil` for each book.
** Pros: Will be easy to extend in the future as we can just mount multiple loans using `LoanSlipUtil` before generating all loans in a single Loan Slip.
** Cons: Will require more code when mounting loans in the Facade class.
* **Alternative 2:** Re-create `LoanSlipDocument` whenever a new loan comes in.
** Pros: Will only need to make adjustments to `Logic` component to contain an `Optional<LoanSlipDocument>` field and update accordingly whenever a new `Loan` comes in.
** Cons: Violates Single Responsibility Principle as the Logic class will now have to change if we change the implementation of LoanSlipDocument.
// end::printLoanSlip[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* a librarian in a small town library that has to serve many library users (borrowers) quickly
* has a need to manage a significant number of books and borrowers
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: Many people visit the neighborhood library to borrow books and also donate their books. There is
always a long queue in this small library and the librarian would have to type quickly to handle the long queue. Liberry
can manage a library system faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
