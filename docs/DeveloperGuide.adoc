== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `add t/Animal Farm a/George`.

.Component interactions for `add t/Animal Farm a/George` command
image::AddBook.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `CatalogParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a book).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add t/Animal Farm a/George")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add t/Animal Farm a/George` Command
image::AddBookLogicSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th book in the catalog. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitCatalog()`, causing the modified state of the catalog after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `catalogStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted catalog state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new book. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the book was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the book being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Book loaning feature

==== Functionalities
The functionalities and commands associated with the book loaning feauture are:

* `loan sn/BOOK_SN`

** Loans out a book based on its serial number.

* `return INDEX [-all]`

** Returns a book based on the index of that book shown on the GUI.

* `renew INDEX [-all]`

** Renews a book based on the index of that book shown on the GUI.

* `reserve sn/BOOK_SN` or `reserve INDEX`

** Reserves a book based on its serial number or index of that book shown on the GUI.

* `pay AMOUNT`

** Pay a fine amount for overdue books.

The rationale for the different types of arguments for the loan, return, renew and reserve may not be apparent at first,
but it is actually very simple.

* When borrowers come to the librarian (our user) to borrow a book, the book itself would have
a serial number. Thus, the user just types in the serial number of the book to be loaned out, instead of using find to
locate that book in LiBerry to use its index.

* Whereas, when a borrower comes to return a book, the librarian only sees a limited list of book that was loaned out by
the borrower on the GUI. Hence, the user need not type the longer serial number to return that book, and instead, types
its index shown in the GUI list. Likewise, the same idea is applied to renewing books

* When reserving books for borrowers, it is possible that the book is found through the GUI, and thus, index is used. Or,
the borrower brings the physical book forward to reserve it as he/she does not want to borrow it now.

==== Implementation

This feature is mainly facilitated by the `Loan` association class between a `Book` and a `Borrower`. The object diagram
just after a book is loaned out can be seen below.

image::LoanObjectDiagram.png[]

In this instance, the `Borrower` with `BorrowerId` K0789 currently has a `Book` with `SerialNumber` B00456 loaned out.
The `Loan` associated to this loan, with `LoanId` L000123, is stored in the `LoanRecords` class of the model component.

Both the `Book` and `Borrower` objects also have access to this `Loan` object.

In each `Loan` object, the `BorrowerId`

The `LoanRecords` class stores all the `Loan` objects tracked by LiBerry in a HashMap, where the key is its `LoanId`.

Immutability of each object is supported to ensure correctness of undo and redo functionality.

===== Loaning

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters a loan command:

image::LoaningActivityDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The else branch of each branch node should have a guard condition `[else]` but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
they are not shown.

When a book is successfully loaned out by a borrower, a new `Loan` object is created. The `LoanId` is automatically generated according
to the number of loans in the `LoanRecords` object in the model. The `startDate` is also automatically set to today's date.
The `endDate` is automatically set according to the loan period set in the user settings. This `Loan` object is added to
`LoanRecords` through the call to `Model#addLoan(loan)`.

The new `Borrower` instance is created by copying the details of the borrower from the original object, and also with this `Loan`
object being added into its `currentLoanList`. The new borrower object then replaces the old borrower object in the
`BorrowerRecords` object in the model. These two steps are done through the method call to `Model#servingBorrowerNewLoan(loan)`.
The new `Book` instance is also created by copying the details of the original book object, and likewise, with this `Loan` object added into it.
Similarly, the new book object also replaces the old book object in the `Catalog` object in the model through the call to
`Model#setBook(bookToBeLoaned, loanedOutBook)`. These were done to support immutability of the objects.

===== Returning

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters a return command:

image::ReturningActivityDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The else branch of each branch node should have a guard condition `[else]` but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
they are not shown.

When a loaned out book is successfully returned by a borrower, the associated `Loan` object is moved from the borrower's
`currentLoanList` to `returnedLoanList`. Inside the book object, this `Loan` object is also removed. Inside this loan
object, the `returnDate` is added according to today's date. The `remainingFineAmount` of this loan object is also
calculated based on the fine amount set in the user settings.

Similarly, the creation of new objects for replacement are also done to support immutability. They are supported by the
methods `Model#setBook(bookToBeReturned, returnedBook)` and `Model#servingBorrowerReturnLoan(returningLoan)`.

===== Renewing

When a book is successfully renewed by a borrower, the `renewCount` of the `Loan` object is incremented by 1
and its `dueDate` is also increased by the renew period set in the user settings.

Similarly, the creation of new objects for replacement are also done to support immutability.

===== Reserving

When a book is successfully reserved by a borrower, the `Book` object is marked as reserved and is added to the borrower's
`reservedBookList`.

Similarly, the creation of new objects for replacement are also done to support immutability.

===== Paying fines

When a fine amount is successfully paid by a borrower, the `remainingFineAmount` and `paidFineAmount` of the loans in
the borrower's `returnedLoanList` is updated accordingly.

Similarly, the creation of new objects for replacement are also done to support immutability.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: File storage of loans

Inside the model, for each current loan (loans that are not returned yet), the `Book`, the `Borrower` and the `LoanRecords`
point to the same the same `Loan` object. LiBerry's storage system is such that `Catalog` stores the books,
`BorrowerRecords` stores the borrowers and `LoanRecords` stores the loans. Thus, a decision was made to decide how these
oans are serialized and stored in the user's file system.

* **Alternative 1:** Save the whole `Loan` object in each book in the `catalog.json` and save the the whole of every `Loan`
object in each borrower in `borrowerrecords.json`. The `Loan` object is also duplicated in `loanrecords.json`.
** Pros: Easy to implement. No need to read storage files in a specific order.
** Cons: Storage memory size issues. Same information is duplicated and stored in all 3 storage files.

* **Alternative 2 (selected choice):** Save only the `LoanId` of each `Loan` object in each book in the `catalog.json`
and save a list of `LoanId` in each borrower in `borrowerrecords.json`. The whole `Loan` object is only saved in
`loanrecords.json`. When reading the storage files at the start of the application, `loanrecords.json` need to be read
in first, before the borrowers and books can be read in as they would get the loan objects from the `LoanRecords` based
on their `LoanId` s.
** Pros: Uses less memory as only `LoanId` is stored for the books and borrowers, instead of the whole serialized loan objects.
Also, LoanRecords thus serve as a single source of truth.
** Cons: Must ensure that the reading of stored files are in the correct order, and also correct `Loan` objects are referenced
after reading in `borrowerrecords.json` and `catalog.json`. Method used to retrieve a `Loan` object from its `LoanId` must
also be fast enough as there can be hundreds of thousands of loans.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support recording of loans in LoanRecords

* **Alternative 1:** Use a list data structure, such as an `ArrayList` to store the loans in the model component.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Easy to obtain insertion order of the loans and sort through the list.
** Cons: Slow to search for a `Loan` based on its `LoanId`, i.e., O(n) time, as the list must be traversed to find the
correct associated `Loan` object. These additional time taken adds up when reading the storage files during the starting
up of the application and can make the application feel laggy and unresponsive at the start.

* **Alternative 2 (selected choice):** Use a `HashMap` to store the loans, where the key is its `LoanId`.
** Pros: Fast to retrieve a `Loan` object based on its `LoanId`, i.e., O(1) time.
** Cons: Insertion order is not preserved. Have to traverse through all the loan objects in the HashMap to check their
`startDate` in order to obtain their insertion order.

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* a librarian in a small town library that has to serve many library users (borrowers) quickly
* has a need to manage a significant number of books and borrowers
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: Many people visit the neighborhood library to borrow books and also donate their books. There is
always a long queue in this small library and the librarian would have to type quickly to handle the long queue. LiBerry
can manage a library system faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
