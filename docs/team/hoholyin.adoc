== PROJECT: LiBerry

---

== Overview
This portfolio aims to highlight my contributions to our team project, 'LiBerry'.

'LiBerry' is a library management system that is designed for small communities with a lack of expertise and
resources to manage a library.

This library management system is able to:

* Add books to the library
* Remove books from the library
* Register borrowers
* Loan and return books to borrowers
* Calculate loan periods and fines for any overdue loans

I was in charge of implementing the book related features.
Additionally, I am responsible for the code quality and testability of the team's code base throughout the entire development phase.
In this portfolio, I will illustrate my contributions in documenting the user guide and developer guide.
These documentations serve to aid librarians and developers in understanding the features of the software.

This is what the main page of our system looks like:

The figure above illustrates the main page librarians will navigate in while using the software.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my contributions in terms of coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

=== *Major enhancement - Generating Loan Slip*
The ability to *automatically generate loan slips in Portable Document Format (PDF)* for every loan.

****
* *Depth*: This feature is deeply linked with the loan features.
Not only does it generate viewable information about a new loan, it also syncs up with the renew feature and generates information about a loan renewal as well.
Furthermore, the implementation has to support the undo/redo features.

* *Completeness*: This feature is complete with the intended styling of the loan slip and is rigorously tested in many test cases. It fully behaves the way it was conceived to be.

* *Effort*: This feature required in-depth understanding of:
** How to add libraries from the Maven Central Repository
** How to handle file input
** How to handle file output
** How to create PDFs from text.
** How to use the 'iText7' Library suitably for 'LiBerry' by reading the 'iText7' documentation

These additional information are not in the scope of the course and would therefore require intensive research on my part.
****

==== What the feature does
This feature generates loan slips so that the librarian can immediately print the loan slip for the borrower.
The printed loan slip contains all information about the loan or renew, including a list of loaned books and the due date of these loans.

==== Justification
Since our target group is small impoverished communities, it is unlikely they will have reliable internet access to check the status of their loans.
Therefore, it will be suitable for librarians to provide them with a printed version of the loan.

==== Highlights
This feature is challenging to implement as it will require us to create a new PDF document from scratch.
I was required to understand a great deal about file input and output in Java, which is something out of the scope of the course.
On top of that, this document will have to be suitably styled as a loan slip populated with information about the loans.

==== Credits
This feature is made possible with the 'iText 7' library. However, it was still required of me to understand both the
Java `File` class and the API well such that I can use it appropriately in the context of our project.

This is how a generated loan slip looks like.

In Figure 2, we can see all books loaned by borrower 'Bill' recorded and generated in a printable loan slip.

=== *Other enhancements* - Book-related features
On top of the feature to generate loan slips, I am also primarily involved the implementation of the basic book-related core features.
These features include:

==== The ability to *add books*
* This feature allows the librarian to start tracking the movement of books using the system.
****
* *Depth*: This is a basic core feature of the system and is therefore.
* *Completeness*: This is a basic core feature of the system and is therefore.
* *Effort*: This is a basic core feature of the system and is therefore.
****

==== The ability to *delete books*.
* This feature allows the librarian to update the catalog when a book goes missing.
****
* *Depth*: This is a basic core feature of the system and is therefore.
* *Completeness*: This is a basic core feature of the system and is therefore.
* *Effort*: This is a basic core feature of the system and is therefore.
****

==== The ability to *display information* about a book.
* This feature aids the librarian in retrieving more information about a book when a borrower enquires about it.
****
* *Depth*: This is a basic core feature of the system and is therefore.
* *Completeness*: This is a basic core feature of the system and is therefore.
* *Effort*: This is a basic core feature of the system and is therefore.

=== *Other contributions*:

==== Project management:
* Managed the release of https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/releases/tag/v1.3.1[`v1.3`] on GitHub. In `v1.3`, we have the following additional features:
** Pay fines
** Renew loans
** Generate loan slip
** Edit Borrower details
** Search overdue books and books that are on loan

==== Enhancements to existing features:
These enhancements are done through the following Pull Requests:

* https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/pull/177[[#177\]]: Created a borrower panel in the Graphical User Interface to list books that the borrower has currently loaned.
* https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/pull/147[[#147\]]: Made the `Book` Object immutable in preparation for the undo/redo feature.
* https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/pull/206[[#206\]]: Increased test coverage for the source code, thereby increasing code quality and testability.

== Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|_This section outlines my contributions to the team's User Guide. It demonstrates my ability to write documentation for librarians so that they can learn how to add, delete and loan books using the software._
|===

=== Add and Delete book
The ability to add and delete books to and from the system will help librarians track the status of all books with ease. +
{nbsp}

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=bookRelated]
{nbsp}

=== Loan book
The feature to loan books will allow librarians to mark that the book has been loaned to a particular borrower.
In this feature, I implemented and documented the loan slip generation feature, allowing librarians to understand how to generate a loan slip when serving a borrower.
The other descriptions on the loan feature is written by See Zi Yang. +

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|_This section highlights my contributions to the Developer Guide.
The following excerpts from the 'LiBerry' Developer Guide demonstrates my ability to communicate with other developers to aid them in understanding how the book-related features and the loan slip generation feature work._
