== PROJECT: LiBerry

== Overview
This portfolio aims to highlight my contributions to our team project, 'LiBerry'.

'LiBerry' is a library management system that is designed for small communities with a lack of expertise and
resources to manage a library.

This library management system is able to:

* *Add books* to the library
* *Delete books* from the library
* *Register* borrowers
* *Loan* and *return* books to borrowers
* *Calculate loan periods* and *fines* for any overdue loans

I was in charge of implementing the *Generate loan slip* feature and the *Book* feature.
Additionally, I am responsible for the *code quality and testability* of the team's code base throughout the entire development phase. +

In this portfolio, I will illustrate my contributions in documenting the user guide and developer guide.
These documentations serve to aid librarians and developers in understanding the features of the software.

Let us begin by taking a look at the main page of our system in the figure below.

The figure above illustrates the main page librarians will navigate in while using the software.

=== *Major enhancement - Generate Loan Slip feature*
This feature allows librarians to *automatically generate loan slips in Portable Document Format (PDF)* for every loan.
I will explain in detail below what the feature is about and why it is an important feature.


==== What the feature does
This feature *generates loan slips* so that the librarian can immediately print the loan slip for the borrower.
The printed loan slip contains all information about the loan or renew, including a list of loaned books and the due date of these loans.

==== Justification
Since our target group is small impoverished communities, it is unlikely they will have reliable internet access to check the status of their loans.
Therefore, it will be suitable for librarians to provide them with a printed version of the loan.

==== Highlights
This feature is challenging to implement as it will require us to create a new PDF document from scratch.
It was required of me to understand a great deal about file input and output in Java, which was something out of the scope of the course.
Additionally, this document would have to be suitably styled to display a certain level of professionalism.

==== Why this is a major feature
This feature represents most of the core features of 'LiBerry' in a condensed PDF.
I have provided a breakdown below as to how this feature achieves the required *depth*, *completeness* and *level of effort*.

* *Depth*: This feature is deeply linked with the Book, Loan and Borrower features.
The information being displayed in the PDF document are: +
{nbsp}
** Borrower-related information:
*** The name of the borrower
*** The ID of the borrower +
{nbsp}
** Book-related information:
*** Serial number of book being loaned out
*** Title of book being loaned out +
{nbsp}
** Loan-related information:
*** Date of loan
*** List of books being loaned
*** List of books being renewed
*** Their respective due dates +
{nbsp}

* *Completeness*: This feature is complete with the intended style has been rigorously tested in many test cases.
It was intended for the loan slip to display the following information: +
{nbsp}

** Details of Borrower
** Details of multiple loans in a single loan slip
** Details of renewed loans

All the above information is accurately displayed in the generated loan slip from 'LiBerry' `v1.4`. +
{nbsp}

* *Effort*: This feature required an in-depth understanding of: +
{nbsp}
** How to leverage on Gradle to add libraries from the Maven Central Repository
** How to get resources when the application in a `.jar` format
** How to handle file input
** How to handle file output
** How to create PDFs from text
** How to use the 'iText7' Library suitably for 'LiBerry' by reading and understanding the 'iText7' documentation

These additional information are not in the scope of the course and therefore required intensive research on my part. +
{nbsp}

To allow us to fully visualise this feature, let us take a look at how a generated loan slip will looks like.

{nbsp}

In Figure 2, we can see all books loaned by 'Bill' recorded and generated in a printable loan slip.

==== Credits
This feature is made possible with the 'iText 7' library. However, it was still required of me to understand both the
Java `File` class and the API well such that I can use it appropriately in the context of our project.
{nbsp}

---

=== *Secondary enhancement - Book feature*
On top of the feature to generate loan slips, I am also primarily involved the implementation of the book-related core features.
In the Book feature, we have the following sub-features:

** The ability to *add books*
* Allows the librarian to start tracking the movement of books using the system

** The ability to *delete books*.
* Enables the librarian to update the catalog when a book goes missing

** The ability to *display information* about a book.
* Aids the librarian in retrieving more information about a book when a borrower inquires about it +
{nbsp}

I will now share more details about this feature and how it plays a crucial role in 'LiBerry'.

==== What the feature does
This feature allows the librarian to manage the catalog of books in the system using the set of sub-features mentioned above.

==== Justification
This feature is a *must-have* for all library management systems as it provides a foundation for all other higher-level features (such as loaning and renewing books) to work.

==== Highlights
The main difficulty of this feature is the implementation of the ability to *display information of a book*.
This sub-feature requires the use of an `Observer` pattern that observes the loan history of the book.
With every new loan or renew, the info window will be updated.
I have provided a breakdown below as to how this feature achieves the required *depth*, *completeness* and *level of effort*.

* *Depth*: The Book feature is a representation of the cohesive Book component, which supports the ability to:
** *Add* a book to the catalog
** *Delete* a book from the catalog
** *Display information* about a book in the catalog, which includes:
*** Serial number of book
*** Title of book
*** Author of book
*** Genres of book, if any
*** Loan status (if it is currently on loan or not)
*** Loan history +
{nbsp}

* *Completeness*: This feature is cohesively and completely linked to the other core feature such as the Loan feature and the Borrower feature. +
{nbsp}

* *Effort*: Considerable effort was put in to assess the suitability of data structures used to store the books.
Much thought was also put into deciding what information should be displayed in the info window and what is the best way to display these information.

== Contributions to the User Guide

This section outlines my contributions to the team's User Guide.
It demonstrates my ability to write documentation for librarians so that they can learn how to: +

. Manage books in their library using the *Book feature*
. Generate loan slips using the *Generate Loan Slip* feature

=== Book feature
The ability to manage books in the system will help librarians track the status of all books with ease.
In the User Guide documentation of the Book feature, I will cover the following:

. How to use the `add` command
. How to use the `delete` command
. How to use the `info` command +

{nbsp}

=== Generating a loan slip
The done command triggers the generation of a loan slip, which can then be conveniently printed out by the librarian.
In particular, I implemented and documented the loan slip generation feature, allowing librarians to know how to generate a loan slip after serving a borrower.
In the User Guide documentation of this feature, I will cover the following: +

. How the loan slip will be generated when the librarian exits serve mode. +
{nbsp}

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=loanSlip]
