== LiBerry

=== Overview

With the motivation to raise literacy rate in the world and encourage more setups of community libraries, my team has developed
Liberry - a desktop software for managing community and private libraries. The target users are mainly librarians looking to set up
or are already running private or community libraries, especially those in under-developed communities who cannot afford
commercial versions of such software.

LiBerry can execute the basic functions of library management:

* Addition and deletion of books in the catalog
* Registering Borrowers and editing their particulars
* Loan, return, renew and pay fine functions
* Searching through books in the catalog by filters

As part of the requirements of the project, we were given the source code for a common AddressBook
application and were tasked to morph it to something else that is useful.
We were also limited to designing software that takes in the majority of user input through a Command Line Interface
(CLI), though displays information through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

This is what the GUI looks like:

My role was to:

. configure the basic AddressBook software to create a `Borrower` class and its related classes.
. implement borrower-related commands such as the *Register Command*, *Serve Command*, *Done Command*, +
*EditBorrowerCommand* and *UnregisterCommand*.

== Summary of Contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to unregister a borrower*
** What it does: allows the user to unregister previously registered borrowers.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a borrower can be no longer using the library and the app should unregister him or her from the library system.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to many data in the storage.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a Borrower ID generator that auto generates a borrower's ID.
