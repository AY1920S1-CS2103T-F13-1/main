== About the Project
This portfolio aims to highlight my contributions to our team project, 'LiBerry'.

With a common belief to improve literacy in the world, my team decided to create a library management system called
'LiBerry' that is free and easy to use. 'LiBerry' is designed for small communities with a lack of expertise and
resources to manage a library.

This library management system is able to:

* Add books to the library
* Remove books from the library
* Register borrowers
* Mark a book as loaned to a borrower
* Calculate loan periods and fines for any overdue loans

This is what the main page of our system looks like:

== Summary of contributions
|===
|_This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project._
|===

* *Major enhancement*: The ability to *automatically generate loan slips in pdf* for every loan.
** What it does: Allows the librarian to print the generated loan slip for the borrower.
** Justification: Since our target group is small impoverished communities, it is unlikely they will have internet access to check the status of their loans. Therefore, it will be suitable to provide them with a printed version of the loan.
** Highlights: This feature is challenging to implement as it will require us to create a new pdf document from scratch. On top of that, this document will have to be suitably styled as a loan slip using information from the loan.
** Credits: This feature is made possible with the 'iText 7' library. However, it was still required of me to understand the API well and in depth such that I can apply it appropriately to the context of our project.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Implemented the ability to *add books*
** Implemented the ability to *delete books*
** Implemented the ability to *display information* about a book

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed the release of `v1.3` on GitHub. In `v1.3`, we have the following additional features:
**** Pay fines
**** Renew loans
**** Generate loan slip
**** Edit Borrower details
**** Search overdue books and books that are on loan

** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Optimised the generation of a new serial number when a new book is added
**** Done through Pull Request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/pull/118[#118]. This enhancement allows the system to efficiently locate and allocate the smallest available serial number to the new book.
*** Made the `Book` Object immutable in preparation for the undo/redo feature in the future
**** Done through Pull Request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/pull/147[#147]. This modification allows the system to track the different states of the system throughout its usage. This is required in order to implement the undo/redo function.

** Documentation:
*** Wrote the https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc#Design-Model[documentation] for the `Model` component of the system.
*** Described the https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc#generate-loan-slip-feature['Generate Loan Slip'] feature and its design considerations.

** Community:
*** https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3/pull/49/files/22e0d669e265d0f2835df4e4a2d0f15a57b05795[Reviewed](with non-trivial comments) a Pull Request from another group
*** Contributed to forum discussions as a group (Shared a https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/forum/issues/115[tip] on how to check code coverage when running tests)
*** https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3/pull/49/files/22e0d669e265d0f2835df4e4a2d0f15a57b05795[Reported] bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class.

** Tools:
*** Integrated a third party library (iText 7) to the project in https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/pull/150[this] Pull Request

== Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_This section outlines my contributions to the team's User Guide. It demonstrates my ability to write documentation for librarians so that they can learn how to add, delete and loan books._
|===

The ability to add and delete books to and from the system will help librarians track the status of all books with ease.
