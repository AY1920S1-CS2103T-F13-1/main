== LiBerry

=== Overview

In the spirit of spreading education, literacy and a sense of community to the world (and completing our software engineering project), my team has developed
Liberry - a desktop software for managing community and private libraries. The target users are mainly librarians in under-developed communities who cannot afford
commercial versions of such software.

LiBerry can execute the basic functions of library management:

* Addition and deletion of books in the catalog
* Registering Borrowers and editing their particulars
* Loan, return, renew and pay fine functions
* Searching through books in the catalog by filters

As part of the requirements of the project, we were given the source code for a common AddressBook
application and were tasked to morph it to something else that is useful.
We were also limited to designing software that takes in the majority of user input through a Command Line Interface
(CLI), though displays information through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

This is what the GUI looks like:

My role was to:

. configure the basic AddressBook software to accommodate Json-type storage for a catalog, a record of borrowers,
and a record of loans.
. design the *Find Command* to execute given a set of parameters - such as searching by title, genre, loan status etc.

== Summary of Contributions

*Major enhancement*: +
added `find` command - giving the ability to *filter the catalog by various parameters*

* *What it does:*
... Searches books in catalog through filtering by:
.... title
.... author
.... serial number
.... genres
.... loan status (available / loaned / overdue)
... sets the number of books to display in the search results

* *Justification:* +
This feature is very powerful as it helps the user search through the entire catalog quickly according to the query's requirements.
For example, a user may want to find if a certain book of a certain title is in the catalog, but only remembers the word 'Harry' from the title.
This command will show all books in the catalog with the word 'Harry' in it. Another possible use case would be if a borrower, say, a parent,
wanted to check if there were available 'children'
books. A `find 10 g/children -available` command will suffice in bringing out the first 10 books that were available for borrowing belonging
to the genre 'children'.

* *Highlights:* +
This enhancement was decently demanding as it required a way to test every book on whether it met the query requirements.
It showcases my ability to play with functional programming and Streams in Java.
As the predicate used has multiple possible combinations, extensive tests were written to ensure that it worked the way it should.

*Minor enhancement*: +
Made all search parameters (with the exception of book serial number) case insensitive

* *Justification:* +
This feature allows users to be
