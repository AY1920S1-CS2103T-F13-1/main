== PROJECT: LiBerry

== Overview

LiBerry is a desktop library management application for librarians to manage their books, borrowers and loans.
It is a software optimized for librarians who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI), whereby commands are typed into the software. +

Main features of LiBerry:

* Add and remove books
* Comprehensive search system to look for books
* Register new borrowers
* Manage loaning and returning of books
* Track overdue fines payment

My role was to design and implement the code for the loan related features. The following sections further elaborates on these
enhancements I have made. Also included are the details of the relevant documentation I have written in the user and developer guide to
assist users and other developers to understand these features.

== Summary of Contributions

This section summarizes the contributions I have made to the team project, including contributions to the code base, documentation and project management.

* Main enhancement - Loan-related features +
I have added features related to the loaning and returning of books in our library management app, LiBerry.

** What it does: +
This set of features allow our users, librarians, to *loan* out books to borrowers, *return* loaned out books, *renew* loaned
out books, and to record payments of *fines* incurred for overdue books. +
Every time a book is borrowed, both the starting date and due date of the loan are automatically recorded. For each loaned
out book, other than the details of the book and the borrower, the starting date, due date, and returning date,
along with the number of times it has been renewed and the fine incurred after returning are all meticulously tracked.

** Justification +
As the main purpose of a library is to allow visitors to borrow books, these features are core to a library and are
needed for a library to function.

** Highlights +
The implementation of these features was challenging as a whole new set of code had to be written to model each loan occurrence
and to store these information. The book, borrower and the loan object had to be linked efficiently to reduce duplicated information stored. +
Moreover, a great deal of defensive programming was applied as there were many bounds to each of these features. For
example, these features should only work when certain conditions are met, such as when the user is currently serving borrowers
and the inputs correspond to a book that is not on loan. +
Additionally, I also created utility classes like `DateUtil` and `FineUtil` to centralize utility functions that dealt with
dates and fines respectively.

* Other contributions:

** Project management

*** Managed the issues covered for each milestone and set up their deadlines. Also added each feature as an issue and
assigned them to the appropriate team member.

**** The issues and milestones can be seen https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/issues[here].

*** Set up two Github project boards.

**** The project board used to brainstorm and prioritise user stories can be seen https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/projects/2[here].
**** The project board used to keep track of the features and commands can be seen https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/projects/3[here].

*** Updated developer guide to include user stories, use cases and non-functional requirements. Done through pull requests:

**** https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/pull/81[#81] - Included user stories and non-functional requirements specific to LiBerry.
**** https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/pull/157[#157] - Updated non-functional requirements and use cases and added a general use case diagram.

*** Maintained the team project website, including the site headers, navigation bar, badges and photos. Done through pull requests:

**** https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/pull/86[#86] - Updated Travis badges.

** Enhancements to existing features

*** Enhanced code for `Borrower` class to be immutable. Done through pull request:

**** https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/pull/152[#152] - Modified fields in Borrower to be immutable and
added methods in the class to return new copies instead of mutating values in the current object.

*** Upgraded the `set` command to support setting the maximum renew count such that librarians can define what is the maximum number of times
a book can be renewed.
Done through pull request:

**** https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/pull/178[#178] - Modified the `set` command to take in maximum renew
count and integrated this setting to the model component.

*** Updated the user interface to reflect more borrower-related details. Done through pull request:

**** https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/pull/179[#179] - Updated panel dimensions to fit more results and
added more borrower-related information such as total outstanding fine.

** Documentation

*** Improved and rectified the flow, content, styling, legend and diagrams of the user guide and developer guide
according to feedback received from tutor and peers.
Done through pull requests: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/pull/157[#157], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-1/main/pull/163[#163],

** Community

*** Gave in-depth and insightful review of team member's pull requests. Examples includes: ........

*** Reported bugs in the team project to team members in the group chat.

** Tools

*** Integrated a new Github plugin, Coveralls, to the team repository. Coveralls was immensely helpful in tracking the
test coverage of our team's code.

*** Set up Netlify for the team repository to easily and quickly preview changes made to the team website and documentation.
