<p>LiBerry is a desktop library management application for librarians to manage their books, borrowers and loans.
It is a software optimized for librarians who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI), whereby interactions
with the software are done through text commands.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main features of LiBerry includes managing and searching for books, registering new borrowers,
borrowing books and recording fines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This portfolio serves to demonstrate my proficiency in the various aspects of software engineering such as coding,
project management and technical writing skills in crafting documentation that fits the target user.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My role was to design and implement the code for the loan feature, which will be further elaborated in the following sections.
Also included are the details of the relevant documentation I have written in the user and developer guide to
assist users and other developers to understand these features.</p>

<h4 id="what-it-does"><a class="link" href="#what-it-does">What it does</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This set of features allow our users, librarians, to <code>loan</code> books to borrowers, <code>return</code> loaned out books, <code>renew</code> loaned
out books such that their due dates are extended, and to <code>pay</code> fines incurred for overdue books.<br></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="justification"><a class="link" href="#justification">Justification</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the main purpose of a library is to allow visitors to borrow books, this feature set is core to a library and is
needed for a library to function. The tracking of loaned out and returned books is key to managing a library. Allowing
librarians to renew loaned out books can help them better serve borrowers who would want to read the books for a longer
period of time. The fine system for overdue books also tie in nicely with many libraries' policy of charging fines
to deter late returns.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="highlights"><a class="link" href="#highlights">Highlights</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The implementation of these features was challenging as a whole new set of code had to be written to model each loan occurrence
and to store these information. The book, borrower and the loan object had to be linked efficiently to reduce duplicated information stored.
Moreover, a great deal of defensive programming was applied as there were many bounds to each of these features. For
example, these features should only work when certain conditions are met, such as when the user is currently serving borrowers
and the inputs correspond to a book that is not on loan.
Additionally, I also created utility classes like <code>DateUtil</code> and <code>FineUtil</code> to centralize utility functions that dealt with
dates and fines respectively.</p>

<p>The rationale for the different types of arguments for the loan, return, renew and reserve may not be apparent at first,
but it is actually very simple.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When borrowers come to the librarian (our user) to borrow a book, the book itself would have
a serial number. Thus, the user just types in the serial number of the book to be loaned out, instead of using the find
command to locate that book in LiBerry to use its index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whereas, when a borrower comes to return a book, the librarian only sees a limited list of book that was loaned out by
the borrower on the GUI. Hence, the librarian need not type the longer serial number to return that book, and instead, types
its index shown in the GUI list. Likewise, the same idea is applied to renewing books</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When reserving books for borrowers, it is possible that the book is found through the GUI, and thus, index is used. Or,
the borrower brings the physical book forward to reserve it as he/she does not want to borrow it now.</p>

<p>The new <code>Borrower</code> instance is created by copying the details of the borrower from the original object, and also with this <code>Loan</code>
object being added into its <code>currentLoanList</code>. The new borrower object then replaces the old borrower object in the
<code>BorrowerRecords</code> object in the model. These two steps are done through the method call to <code>Model#servingBorrowerNewLoan(loan)</code>.
The new <code>Book</code> instance is also created by copying the details of the original book object, and likewise, with this <code>Loan</code> object added into it.
Similarly, the new book object replaces the old book object in the <code>Catalog</code> object in the model through the call to
<code>Model#setBook(bookToBeLoaned, loanedOutBook)</code>. These were done to support immutability of the objects.</p>

<p>When a loaned out book is successfully returned by a borrower, the associated <code>Loan</code> object is moved from the borrower&#8217;s
<code>currentLoanList</code> to <code>returnedLoanList</code>. Inside the book object, this <code>Loan</code> object is also removed. Inside this loan
object, the <code>returnDate</code> is added according to today&#8217;s date. The <code>remainingFineAmount</code> of this loan object is also
calculated based on the fine amount set in the user settings.</p>

<p>Inside the model, for each current loan (loans that are not returned yet), the <code>Book</code>, the <code>Borrower</code> and the <code>LoanRecords</code>
point to the same the same <code>Loan</code> object. LiBerry&#8217;s storage system is such that <code>Catalog</code> stores the books,
<code>BorrowerRecords</code> stores the borrowers and <code>LoanRecords</code> stores the loans. Thus, a decision was made to decide how these
loans are serialized and stored in the user&#8217;s file system.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1:</strong> Save the whole <code>Loan</code> object in each book in the <code>catalog.json</code> and save the the whole of every <code>Loan</code>
object in each borrower in <code>borrowerrecords.json</code>. The <code>Loan</code> object is also duplicated in <code>loanrecords.json</code>.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easy to implement. No need to read storage files in a specific order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Storage memory size issues. Same information is duplicated and stored in all 3 storage files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2 (selected choice):</strong> Save only the <code>LoanId</code> of each <code>Loan</code> object in each book in the <code>catalog.json</code>
and save a list of <code>LoanId</code> in each borrower in <code>borrowerrecords.json</code>. The whole <code>Loan</code> object is only saved in
<code>loanrecords.json</code>. When reading the storage files at the start of the application, <code>loanrecords.json</code> need to be read
in first, before the borrowers and books can be read in as they would get the loan objects from the <code>LoanRecords</code> based
on their <code>LoanId</code> s.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Uses less memory as only <code>LoanId</code> is stored for the books and borrowers, instead of the whole serialized loan objects.
Also, <code>LoanRecords</code> thus serve as a single source of truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Must ensure that the reading of stored files are in the correct order, and also correct <code>Loan</code> objects are referenced
after reading in <code>borrowerrecords.json</code> and <code>catalog.json</code>. Method used to retrieve a <code>Loan</code> object from its <code>LoanId</code> must
also be fast enough as there can be hundreds of thousands of loans.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1:</strong> Use a list data structure, such as an <code>ArrayList</code> to store the loans in the model component.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easy to implement. Easy to obtain insertion order of the loans and sort through the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Slow to search for a <code>Loan</code> based on its <code>LoanId</code>, i.e., O(n) time, as the list must be traversed to find the
correct associated <code>Loan</code> object. The additional time taken adds up when reading the storage files during the starting
up of the application. Thus, it can make the application feel laggy and unresponsive at the start.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2 (selected choice):</strong> Use a <code>HashMap</code> to store the loans, where the key is its <code>LoanId</code>.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Fast to retrieve a <code>Loan</code> object based on its <code>LoanId</code>, i.e., O(1) time.</p>
</li>

<p>Cons: Insertion order is not preserved. Have to traverse through all the loan objects in the HashMap to check their
<code>startDate</code> in order to obtain their insertion order.</p>
